"""Prompt composition for the four asset types this pipeline produces.

Pure data plus one function — no I/O, no API calls. A prompt is always assembled
in the same order:

    description -> style clause -> per-type framing rules -> reference clause

The framing rules are the part that must never drift: characters and objects are
*reference sheets* consumed by later animation steps, so their layout (white
background, fixed set of views) is fixed here rather than left to the caller.

A ``style`` of ``None`` inverts the first two steps: it names no style and hands
that job to the attached images instead, which also means it swaps the reference
clause for one that does not contradict it.
