"""Background jobs that outlive the request that started them.

One click can spend real credits (an image render) or real quota (a YouTube
search), so that work never runs inside a request. It goes to a thread pool
instead: once :func:`submit` returns, the job runs to the end and writes its
result to disk whether or not anyone is still polling for it.

Each kind of job gets its own pool, so a long WordPress run never queues an
image render behind it, and the pool size is the concurrency cap for that kind:

- ``asset``     - 4 workers. Several generations can run at once, but not an
  unbounded number of paid calls.
- ``youtube``   - 2 workers. Searches are quota, not money.
- ``wordpress`` - 1 worker. Both WordPress jobs append to the same files.

The pool threads are non-daemon on purpose - shutting the server down waits for
an in-flight render rather than discarding one that has already been paid for.
This registry is in-process memory, which is why the backend must run as a
single worker process.
