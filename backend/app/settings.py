"""Process-wide settings: where the shared data lives and where the keys come from.

``DATA_DIR`` is the one folder the backend and the frontend share. The backend
reads and writes it; the frontend mounts it read-only and opens whatever path
the API hands back, so every path that crosses the API is relative to it.

Keys are read from the environment. ``backend/.env`` is loaded for local runs;
under docker compose the same file arrives as ``env_file`` and this is a no-op.
